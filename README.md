# Facial Landmark Detection and Machine Learning Classification

## Overview

This project involves detecting facial landmarks from video files and extracting various features for use in machine learning classification tasks. The primary objectives are:

1. Detect facial landmarks in video frames.
2. Extract meaningful features from the detected landmarks.
3. Train and evaluate machine learning models for lie detection.

The project utilizes the Bag of Lies dataset to develop and test models for detecting deception based on facial landmark features.
